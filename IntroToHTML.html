      HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used
      language to write Web Pages. Hypertext refers to the way in which Web
      pages (HTML documents) are linked together. Thus, the link available on a
      webpage is called Hypertext. As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup
      Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up" a text document with
      tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display. HTML was
      originally developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990. He is also known as the
      father of the web. In 1996, the World Wide Web Consortium became the
      authority to maintain the HTML specifications. HTML also became an
      international standard (ISO) in 2000. HTML5 is the latest version of HTML.
      HTML5 provides a faster and more robust approach to web development.

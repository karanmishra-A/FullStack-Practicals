      Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Framework, and it is useful to
      develop responsive websites without rewriting the code for each device or
      screen. If you code once, it just works for any browser, device, and
      screen. Bootstrap has not only HTML/CSS components but also JS components.
      With Bootstrap, you get to use common HTML elements but with a beautiful
      representation of items. Finally, you can use your own theme on top of
      Bootstrap, making your code the most customizable ever. Bootstrap was
      developed and announced in August 2011 by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton
      while working at Twitter. The purpose of the development was to make
      interface development and maintenance very easy and consistent. Bootstrap
      was not only a framework but a way to make some common design patterns a
      standard in web design and development.

      JavaScript is also known as the Programming Language of web as it is the
      only programming language for Web browsers. JavaScript is an object-based
      scripting language which is lightweight and cross-platform. The programs
      in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web
      page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads. Scripts are provided
      and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or
      compilation to run. The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a
      “JavaScript virtual machine”.

    <h2>About Course</h2>
    <p>
      Full-stack refers to a group of programming languages and tools a
      developer learns to handle both the front-end and back-end development of
      a website. MEAN stack is a popular full-stack framework, which consists of
      MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and NodeJS. Full-stack isn’t necessarily
      restricted to a particular set of languages, while frameworks like MEAN
      stack is. As a full-stack developer, you’ll have to learn multiple
      languages related to web development along with a few concepts of web
      design.
